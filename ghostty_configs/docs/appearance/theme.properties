# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
# 
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
# 
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
# 
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
# 
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
# 
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
# 
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
# 
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
# 
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
# 
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:Rose Pine Dawn,dark:Rose Pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
# 
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
# 
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# 1.1 is a good value. If you want to avoid text that is difficult to read, a

# that text will become black or white.

# 
# This can also be set to `bright`, which uses the bright color palette
# for bold text. For example, if the text is red, then the bold will
# use the bright red color. The terminal palette is set with `palette`
# but can also be overridden by the terminal application itself using

# 
# * `linear` - Perform alpha blending in linear space. This will eliminate
#   the darkening artifacts around the edges of text that are very visible
#   when certain color combinations are used (e.g. red / green), but makes
#   dark text look much thinner than normal and light text much thicker.
#   This is also sometimes known as "gamma correction".
# 
# * `linear-corrected` - Same as `linear`, but with a correction step applied
#   for text that makes it look nearly or completely identical to `native`,
#   but without any of the darkening artifacts.

# Available since: 1.1.0
