# The position of the "quick" terminal window. To learn more about the
# quick terminal, see the documentation for the `toggle_quick_terminal`
# binding action.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `top` - Terminal appears at the top of the screen.
#   * `bottom` - Terminal appears at the bottom of the screen.
#   * `left` - Terminal appears at the left of the screen.
#   * `right` - Terminal appears at the right of the screen.
#   * `center` - Terminal appears at the center of the screen.
# 
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty
# completely.
# 
# Note: There is no default keybind for toggling the quick terminal.
# To enable this feature, bind the `toggle_quick_terminal` action to a key.
quick-terminal-position = top

# The size of the quick terminal.
# 
# The size can be specified either as a percentage of the screen dimensions
# (height/width), or as an absolute size in pixels. Percentage values are
# suffixed with `%` (e.g. `20%`) while pixel values are suffixed with `px`
# (e.g. `300px`). A bare value without a suffix is a config error.
# 
# When only one size is specified, the size parameter affects the size of
# the quick terminal on its *primary axis*, which depends on its position:
# height for quick terminals placed on the top or bottom, and width for left
# or right. The primary axis of a centered quick terminal depends on the
# monitor's orientation: height when on a landscape monitor, and width when
# on a portrait monitor.
# 
# The *secondary axis* would be maximized for non-center positioned
# quick terminals unless another size parameter is specified, separated
# from the first by a comma (`,`). Percentage and pixel sizes can be mixed
# together: for instance, a size of `50%,500px` for a top-positioned quick
# terminal would be half a screen tall, and 500 pixels wide.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
# The layer of the quick terminal window. The higher the layer,
# the more windows the quick terminal may conceal.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `overlay`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears in front of all windows.
# 
#  * `top` (default)
# 
#    The quick terminal appears in front of normal windows but behind
#    fullscreen overlays like lock screens.
# 
#  * `bottom`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears behind normal windows but in front of
#    wallpapers and other windows in the background layer.
# 
#  * `background`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears behind all windows.
# 
# GTK Wayland only.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0

# The namespace for the quick terminal window.
# 
# This is an identifier that is used by the Wayland compositor and/or
# scripts to determine the type of layer surfaces and to possibly apply
# unique effects.
# 
# GTK Wayland only.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
gtk-quick-terminal-namespace = ghostty-quick-terminal

# The screen where the quick terminal should show up.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `main` - The screen that the operating system recommends as the main
#    screen. On macOS, this is the screen that is currently receiving
#    keyboard input. This screen is defined by the operating system and
#    not chosen by Ghostty.
# 
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
# 
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as
#    set in the display settings on macOS. This is a bit confusing because
#    every screen on macOS has a menu bar, but this is the screen that
#    contains the primary menu bar.
# 
# The default value is `main` because this is the recommended screen
# by the operating system.
# 
# Only implemented on macOS.

# Set it to 0 to disable animation completely. This can be changed at

# Only implemented on macOS.

# Automatically hide the quick terminal when focus shifts to another window.
# Set it to false for the quick terminal to remain open even when it loses focus.
# 
# Defaults to true on macOS and on false on Linux/BSD. This is because global
# shortcuts on Linux require system configuration and are considerably less
# accessible than on macOS, meaning that it is more preferable to keep the
# quick terminal open until the user has completed their task.
# This default may change in the future.
quick-terminal-autohide = true

# This configuration option determines the behavior of the quick terminal
# when switching between macOS spaces. macOS spaces are virtual desktops
# that can be manually created or are automatically created when an
# application is in full-screen mode.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `move` - When switching to another space, the quick terminal will
#    also moved to the current space.
# 
#  * `remain` - The quick terminal will stay only in the space where it
#    was originally opened and will not follow when switching to another
#    space.
# 
# The default value is `move`.
# 
# Only implemented on macOS.
# On Linux the behavior is always equivalent to `move`.
# 
# Available since: 1.1.0

# Determines under which circumstances that the quick terminal should receive
# keyboard input. See the corresponding [Wayland documentation](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1#zwlr_layer_surface_v1:enum:keyboard_interactivity)
# for a more detailed explanation of the behavior of each option.
# 
# > [!NOTE]
# > The exact behavior of each option may differ significantly across
# > compositors -- experiment with them on your system to find one that
# > suits your liking!
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `none`
# 
#    The quick terminal will not receive any keyboard input.
# 
#  * `on-demand` (default)
# 
#    The quick terminal would only receive keyboard input when it is focused.
# 
#  * `exclusive`
# 
#    The quick terminal will always receive keyboard input, even when another
#    window is currently focused.
# 
# Only has an effect on Linux Wayland.
# On macOS the behavior is always equivalent to `on-demand`.
